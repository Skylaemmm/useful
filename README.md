## History

useful was originally created by [Alan Malloy](https://github.com/amalloy) and was part of the [flatland](https://github.com/flatland) organisation. In December 2018 it was moved to CLJ Commons for continued maintenance.

It could previously be found at [amalloy/useful](https://github.com/amalloy/useful) and [flatland/useful](https://github.com/flatland/useful). [clj-commons/useful](https://github.com/clj-commons/useful) is the canonical repository now.
